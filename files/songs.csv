106,Billie Eilish,Paparazzi Instagram Monologue,Six Feet Under,2019,2019-11-22,so i just wanted to say something real quick which is yesterday i was at kimmel which was amazing and when i left i had to go to a rehearsal so to walk to the car there was an alley that i walked through like 500 feet to my left was a group of fans and then like 500 feet to my right was what i thought was fans and paparazzi  i started i went to the left side i walked all the way over to them and hugged them all i took pictures and talked to them for a second didn't sign anything because i like don't do that that's something i don't do because i used to and i realised all anyone did was sell everything that i signed so i stopped doing that it's kind of a policy of mine that i don't  so i talked to them hugged them all i went to the other side and as i got closer like they were cheering for me and stuff and shouting for my name and stuff and so i walked  and as i got closer i kind of realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and ebayers which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldn't give less of a fuck about me at all  but i didn't want to like be disrespectful at all so i went up to them all and i like tried to get like hugs and try to touch all of their hands like do that down the line or whatever and i started to do that nobody put their hands out nobody tried to hug me backi hugged one girl at the end and so she was really sweet  but then i tried to walk like a couple feet across from where they were not where the first group was but like in the same area that i was in because i thought that's where there were fans  when i looked over there they were gone and i was like ok well i guess nobody here really wants anything from me besides a fucking autograph which i don't do because these bitches will sell that shit  like i'll sign something if it's like for a special occasion or if somebody's in need or whatever of course i'm gonna do that but i have this whole thing about not signing things because i just want to be there i'd way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fucking sign something so you can sell that shit  i don't do that and i've tried to make that clear like a billion times  and i said it before i went over to them  anyway  i started to walk away because i realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person um and so i walked away  as i started to walk away back to the car they all started to boo me  and then they all started calling me a little bitch and saying i'm gonna lose my grammy nominations and you know what a little fucking you know whatever just cursing me out and shit  damn dude like  then i started hearing them comparing they kept being like lorde would have stopped i'm like i did stop i walked 500 fe i walked like 000 feet to come say hi to you and give some hugs and y'all are booing me and calling me a little bitch  like the fact that people can switch up like that clicks fingersdamn like wait outside for you and then immediately they don't get what they want and they boo you and fucking curse at you  i'm like bro i'm 7 you're  oh my god this shit isexasperated whoo i turned around ready to fucking pounce and then i got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction which is probably good and it's probably stupid dumb of me making these videos but  mmanyway the only reason i'm making this video is because i saw a video of this all happening and i just wanted to clarify what actually happened because if you watch the video it literally looks like i'm watching by a bunch of fans and like completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them which is not at all what happened  i literally walked from the other side of the alley which was like 000 feet which is fine i'm like happy to do it but i walked over there literally only to say hi only to hug people i literally went over and i was like i don't want pictures i want to hug and i got pictures of me shoved into my fucking face and no love whatsoever  so i left and then i got booed and got called a little bitch and got told that i'm gonna lose my grammys  i probably am gonna lose the grammys but it's okay though i'm not worried about that it's the nomination that counts  anyway i don't know i just wanted to i don't even knowi went back to the other side where the real fans were and i was like guys they booed me and they were very sweet you guys are my friends i love you a lot  and to the grown men that booed me and called me a little bitch i hope the best for you i hope you can find someone else you can use to make money off of and belittle so yeah all the best  love you paparazzi

221,Drake,Come Winter,Room for Improvement,2006,2006-02-14,drake talking yeah this dedicated to canada man the whole up north a lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter but listen   drake i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now it's december i'm driving and she's like where's my hi it's weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin' and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties  drake talking yeah man it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls y'know wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow   drake forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since i'm driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesn't answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat she's bold but i roll with it i'm impressed cause she's sweet then she says i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but i'm obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the  is good there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this i'm kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and it's kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached i'm thinkin off i should've been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho  drake talking yeah uh i told ya'll i had a story for you right uh ya man it's what it is   drake and now i'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say i'm actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone i'mma hold here down tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and it's dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and it's a shame she had me convinced that she could've been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime   drake talking i miss you most of all my darling beat fades out give me a second to gather my thoughts fades back in strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spring such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on 'em right strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing i'm still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby  4 drake i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drake's committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and we'd assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin' we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different it's a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin' crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin' i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin' the face the breast the bras the toes i'm still  and a long night draws to a close cause it's a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside we'll never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified it's what i'm lookin for to carry me through yet i can't seem to find it every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least there's some room to ride there's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive  voice strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring

268,Drake,2016 MTV VMAs Vanguard Award Intro for Rihanna,Room for Improvement,2016,2016-08-28,the first time the first time i met robyn fenty was 005 she was shooting a music video at a restaurant called avacado in toronto the song was pon de replay and the director and the director of the video was little x i was duced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner it's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called work  today the world knows little x as director x they know me as drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta but eleven years later they still know rihanna as the one and only rihanna  captivating from day one the iconic being that is rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going for them that's often the peak but for her that was a starting point as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since  when it comes to music she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release when it comes to performances they swarm in masses just to be in her presence obviously and when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself which is when it gets a little awkward  what's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats awards and accomplishments what's most impressive is the person some artists need to play a character to achieve success some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in she succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does which is being herself  this woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from barbados surrounded by the same friends speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at ovo fest we love the music which can change styles from album to album we love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year but most of all we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one  she's someone she's someone i've been in love with since i was  years old she's one of my she's one of my best friends in the world all my adult life i've looked up to her even though she's younger than me she's a living breathing legend in our industry ladies and gentlemen the recipient of the michael jackson vanguard award for 06 rihanna

385,Drake,Tough Day at the Office [Rolling Stone Apology],Comeback Season,2017,2017-10-14,with today being the 5th anniversary of so far gone i figured it's fitting to return to it's place of its origin in order to clear the air about an extremely emotional day i completely support and agree with rolling stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary phillip seymour hoffman he is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication my frustration stemmed from the way it was executed the circumstances at hand are completely justifiable on the magazines behalf but i was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating they ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not i would have waited until it was my time because i understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but i just wasn't given that option and that made me feel violated i apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would i ever want to offend the hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment i am still the same person today i was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly these days are the worst ones waking up after a great night in the studio and it's your day to be picked apart after dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time so here i am having that moment i once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way i respect rolling stone for being willing to give a kid from toronto a shot at the cover i guess this is a day to learn and grow  sincerely  the boy

438,Drake,ESPYs Conference Call,Heartbreak Drake,2014,2014-07-11,connor shell  youre so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like lebron to make that decision and that ultimate responsibility  drake  yeah i mean i think that for the last week and a half ive probably been bothering lebron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be i think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life hes in i dont think that theres a better way to deal with it than how he just did i think if we can give out an award at the espys for incredible essay writing i would definitely love to present that to him because i think what he just did was patriotic in its own way was courageous and was just to me i think its going to be one of the most historic things of our generation  im just honored to know him and glad that ive gotten to no pun intended witness this moment for sure i think its an incredible thing  i actually woke up kind of late today so im just catching on its a great feeling for me i cant wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud i am because hes been a friend of mine for a long time  shell  obviously youve joined saturday night live and weve had justin timberlake host the show are you going to take a more musical approach to the espys than what weve seen in the past  drake  i think obviously one of the talents that im able to bring to the espys is music but im just going to get up there and i want to just prepare a great night for people i think we have prepared an incredible night for people i definitely want to incorporate music but im not there to put on a strictly musicbased show yeah we definitely have some incredible pretapes yeah i think its just going to be a great night overall im there to deliver a great hosting job  shell  what makes the perfect espys host weve seen some amazing people like justin timberlake and john hamm and even lebron james what strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer  drake  well i think what makes a perfect espys host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats but i think most importantly what i bring is the fact that i feel that i know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys i have personal relationships with i think im going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that i dont know  to me its just about knowing the room that youre in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve  shell  hosting a sports awards show what do you feel is musics role in sports  drake  well i said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go i think that when i speak to any of my friends that play sports theyre always super into music whether it be rap or other genres my dream in life or my other dream in life that ill obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league so i think theyre synonymous in that way we inspire each other and i think thats what really ties music and sports together  shell  this is a question for the producer and if possible i have a followup for drake with the lebron news and the decision that was so successful for espn was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the espys did anybody reach out were you close  maura mandt  no there was not an attempt to have that be there and with the decision it wasnt something we were looking to have that announcement be on the espys certainly if lebron wanted to announce on the espys i would have happily had him there i think what the espys is about is the sports world plays out over the year and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective and thats what you look for the host for  were going to be reflecting on the year and lebron is something that happened so it will definitely be something that well address in the show but just like in sports we dont try to make that news happen it unfolds  shell  drake in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance and a lot of times in hiphop thats kind of also a part of rap music and its always been do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage whether it be metaphorically or outright in hiphop  drake  i think thats a funny question i think its a good fit i definitely think that hiphop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for i think were not trying to end peoples careers or make people feel bad in any way and thats kind of most of the time what problems in hiphop are about so our night like i said is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports  so yeah i think there is definitely a difference though being clever with words is being clever with words so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has but i think the end goals are a bit different  shell  youre also being aware of public perception for instance you instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer right and you so like you definitely have i dont know how to put it maybe a love triangle thing going on with skylar and shell probably be there can we expect a joke or where youll mention it like you did with snl when you did the whole dated rihanna thing everyone loved it so can we expect that now that youll be hosting the espys  drake  well i obviously dont want to give away the material but i do have a growing affection for skylar and im not sure shell be able to make it but im sure ill give you a treat if you enjoy my past references im sure if i havent done it already now that i know youre looking for it i might stick one in there for sure you never know  shell  one of the things about espn and the espys is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the buildup  today i dont know if you realize this but youve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that chris brown posted up i just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means  drake  well as far as the latter end of the question id rather not comment on it but i know that our goal is obviously the night of the espys to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards i think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet thats why im excited  weve been working hard like i said on the pretapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night which i can 00 guarantee it will  shell  is cleveland your new favorite sports city how are you going to incorporate a wiggins manziel and lb james into your espy segment  drake  first of all id like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks i do not team jump ive been  in the past ive always supported the player and not the institution unless its the kentucky wildcats or the toronto raptors those are two teams that i will never stray from but what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer whether it comes to football or obviously basketball i have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams  so its not that im team jumping im just a supportive friend with the recent news of course im going to go  of course im going to go watch games in cleveland if not for lebron who like i said has been a brother to me for years i mean weve got three kids from toronto on one team plus we have manziel who again is part of our family and like a brother  so i definitely have to look into some real estate in cleveland and maybe make some trips this year i might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best  but yeah like i said my teams will always forever be who they are but yes i will support the group that has shifted to cleveland i think that for cleveland a place that ive been time and time again touring i just think its going to be greet i really would love to see that city grow because theyre just a supportive group of people and it is a great place so im really excited  shell  so the espys is your second host gig this year snl was amazing by the way so is hosting something that youre trying to do more of or are you just working on more music you have a lot to write about now that youre a bachelor again  drake  well actually my status hasnt changed just to clear that up ive always been out here coasting but aside from that the espys is my main focus like snl when i commit to something i dont let my focus stray  so for maura to give me this opportunity to host i dont take it lightly i put everything on hold to be  to give the best performance that i possibly can at this awards show and then from there i have things coming up whether its the ovo fest or the tour with lil wayne which is a real thing which a lot of people dont know if its a real thing or not but its very real and its going to be very competitive and then from there ill figure out the next steps for me  im always working on new music but the espys is the main focus right now and well figure out whats next afterwards  shell  one thing we learned about you after hosting snl is youre a tremendous impressionist i personally loved the katt williams and lil wayne  with having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show   drake  yeah im actually excited to say that i definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance and that is something that i actually pride in that i studied for i love finding a character and getting into that character especially if i know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms so yes i will be doing impressions during the espys and theyre good im excited  theyre great  shell  are you bringing your lint roller  drake  oh yes i think ill probably have it somewhere around maybe i should i should bring it out on stage you shouldnt have said it on the call you should have anonymously sent that tip in maybe we would have used the joke no i think ill be lintfree that night ill have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit  shell  so we know that you wore some custom calvin klein outfits for your tour are you planning on the same fashion wearing any calvin klein suits and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what theyre going to wear  drake  im not exactly sure what brands im going to be wearing right now im sort of still like i said very focused on the show ill figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers ill be wearing but im more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that ill be draped in for you all to admire so thats really what my main focus is but ill get my suits together im also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself i might just cut to somebody and i wont have to say anything  shell  you have so many relationships with a lot of athletes is there anyone in particular that you havent met yet that youre looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that youre with already given you any advice about hosting  drake  well i mean ive gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends you know one of my mentors who is not an athlete but obviously jamie foxx a previous host and a big reason why i asked to be a part of this just because that performance that he gave i believe he hosted twice or three times oh twice right it was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was so his mentorship and advice has been great to me is there anybody that im looking forward to meeting i mean yeah i was going to say ive never met skylar im sure it will be extremely awkward when i do but i guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up which she probably wont her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something but yeah if i ever get to meet her i probably owe her an apology right off the bat its been all in good spirits but yeah that is the one person id like to meet  just for that last person i also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music i want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down yeah nick whatever his name is because he didnt win so thats how hes going to be remembered nick whatever his name is  shell  can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you and how many are coming from the writing staff also if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song  drake  oh very good double question well for the first part the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible we have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady maura all the way down to the writers and everybody thats involved everyone involved has been incredible to work with weve been at it now for three months i think just on and off meeting and talking and brain storming as far as ideas being mine i am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that i submitted are what im going to be performing or delivering on wednesday night whether it be music jokes and pretaped pieces i was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it  is writing a joke harder than writing a song i think that because of the way i write songs which is very honest raw emotion about my life i think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because its just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding drake song as the public would deem it  but yeah i mean all my music is so honest that sometimes its hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself when youre able to be lighthearted and joke around i enjoy it it comes a little quicker than songs do  mandt  id like to make a comment on the collaboration process having worked on the show a number of years one of the things that really resonates in the content is when its authentic from the person delivering it being able to have the access weve had to drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on whats coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life it really elevates it so its definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved  we had a shoot the other day from one of the skits and on set he was coming up with stuff and you guys will see it and know what im talking about when you see the show but there was no script in certain areas of it it was really like an improv session and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see im really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show
